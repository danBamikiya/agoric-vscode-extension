## Options

### agoric.autoUpdate

By default, on startup, **Agoric** checks for SDK updates and updates the version locally.
If you want to opt out of this, set the `agoric.autoUpdate` option to false. Eg:

{
  "agoric.autoUpdate": false
}
```

### agoric.installDir

By default, this extension installs the Agoric SDK in the home directory. Configure a custom install directory by changing the field. Eg:
